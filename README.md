# Flower-Recognition
1.Importing all the required modules to run our code
2. Use the ImageFolder present in torchvision.datasets to first prepare datasets
3.The images are unstructured data we need to convert them to tensors. 


Note: As classification of flower
species is an important task, it is commonly studied and many
different approaches have been developed by researchers.
Previously methods such as histogram of oriented gradients,
deformable part models, and scale-invariant feature
transformation, feature extraction, non-linear classifiers have
been used. Then the study focused on segmentation and
classification by using handcrafted feature engineering
(Wäldchen & Mäder, 2018). Today, however, the best
performances have been achieved with CNNs. CNN
accomplishes the need for robustness and eliminated the need for
manual features. CNNs are similar to neural networks but do not
require feature engineering (Narvekar & Rao, 2020)
